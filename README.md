# DynamicLandscapes
This repository aims to explore the effects of patch and connectivity dynamics on species diversity. 
The main goal is to strengthen existing metacommunity theory by extending it to dynamic landscapes. We are running a protocol combining simulations and analytical expectations to test the robustness of the assumptions and to compare the predictions using static and dynamic landscapes. The repository contains three folders. 
DATA contains empirical data of landscape dynamics.
CODES contain the algorithms to run the protocol organized in different folders and
SHARELATEX contains the text and refs in .tex and .bib respectively.
