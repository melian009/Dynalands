# DynamicLandscapes

This repository explores the role (of patch and) connectivity dynamics on species diversity. We aim to strengthen existing metacommunity theory by extending it to dynamic landscapes. The repository contains a protocol combining simulations and analytical expectations to compare the predictions between static and dynamic landscapes. The repository is based on the working paper uploaded to bioRxiv  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/26/021220.short


The following are the folders included in the repo:: 

DATA contains empirical data of landscape dynamics. 

PROTOCOL shows the steps to contrast predictions between static and dynamic landscapes. 

CODES contain the algorithms to run simulations
