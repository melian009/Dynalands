## Biodiversity dynamics in landscapes with fluctuating connectivity

### Ecography DOI: http://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06385

### SUMMARY
Biodiversity can increase in both high and low-connected landscapes. Yet, we lack predictions related to biodiversity dynamics when accounting for the temporal heterogeneity in the connections among the habitats of a landscape. Here, we study the relationship between fluctuations in landscape connectivity and biodiversity dynamics at local and regional scales. We contrast predictions about species richness between landscapes with and without fluctuations in connectivity. Our results show that local, alpha, and regional, gamma, richness can increase together in dynamic landscapes characterized by periodic connectivity, clarifying empirical findings of high biodiversity in both low and high-connected landscapes. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in connectivity increase the overall number of species coexisting in dynamic landscapes when compared with static landscapes with no fluctuations in connectivity. Extending metacommunity theory, by including fluctuations in landscape connectivity, can thus provide new testable predictions about species diversity across broad spatiotemporal scales in rapidly changing landscapes.
