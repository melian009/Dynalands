# DynamicLandscapes
This repository aims to explore the effects of patch and connectivity dynamics on species diversity.
We will run a protocol combining simulations and analytical expectations to test the sensitivity and robustness of the assumptions.
The repository contains three folders. Data contains empirical data of landscape dynamics. Codes contain the algorithms 
to run the protocol organized in different folders and Sharelatex contains the text and refs in .tex and .bib respectively.
