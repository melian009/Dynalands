# DynamicLandscapes

This repository explores the role of patch and connectivity dynamics on species diversity. We aim to strengthen existing metacommunity theory by extending it to dynamic landscapes. The repository contains a protocol combining simulations and analytical expectations to compare the predictions between static and dynamic landscapes. The repository is based on the working paper uploaded to bioRxiv  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/26/021220.short


The following are the folders included in the repo:: 

DATA contains empirical data of landscape dynamics. 

PROTOCOL shows the steps to contrast predictions between static and dynamic landscapes. 

CODES contain the algorithms to run the protocol. 

WORKINGPAPER  documents the latex files of the original ms., and 

WORKSHOPS illustrate moments that contributed to build this repository.

Codes, data and the docs associated to the working paper are all available under the LICENSE file. Please let us know if you find these docs useful for your research.
