Amphibians data downloaded from here
Hi Carlos,

I think you have made an very good job in replying to the reviewers'
comments. Hopefully the editor will be appreciative of this effort. I
don't have any comments to the revision.

In what language is the code for individual based model from the
Rosindell paper that you plan to modify to apply to the continent drift
project? I think we should try to run this model on amphibians. The
global distribution maps of all ~6000 species are freely available at
http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data and a
phylogeny has already been built (see attached paper). We can optimize
our model based on both phylogeny and species composition/richness in
each grid cell.
