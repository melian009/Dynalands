Dynamic landscapes 
There are different approaches taken when reconstructing past climates, and there are a few related
limitations. Deep time environmental variables, such as ice coverage and the expansion and
contraction of the north polar ice cap, were likely very influential, but are notoriously hard to
reconstruct --- mention frequeny and amplitude of glacial and interglacial periods -- 

Here, we use a topography-driven approach in order to obtain climatic inferences based
on high-spatial resolution. Due to limited direct data from deep time, and our temporal and spatial
resolution in reconstructions, we may miss important effects, such as micro-climatic regions that may
have acted as stepping-stones. To address this, one could compare our reconstructions with time
series information from high resolution general circulation models when these become available (Lunt
et al., 2016). Another issue is that the meta-analysis of phylogeny assumes that phylogenies have the
same level of reliability and accuracy as the dating. These considerations, which were not considered
here, may, in fact, differ depending on the statistical method used and the availability of fossil records.
Finally, while the statistical analyses indicate regional differences in species richness, a more direct
approach to link diversity to orogeny would be to simulate the spatial diversification and evolution of
lineages over dynamic landscapes and compare expectations to empirical patterns (Pellissier et al.,
2017; Descombes et al., 2018).
